               So why did we move to an all-inclusive pricing and why does the base price seems higher? Here is why. GST has been slashed from 18% to 5%, however none of the Input Tax Credits are available to us any longer, thereby increasing our effective input costs. Given the increased costs, benefit of tax reduction is being offset at this time. We are working overtime to reduce the input tax impact, so that we can eventually pass on the benefit to you.
